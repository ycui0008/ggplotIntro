# ggplotIntro

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ggplotIntro is to use a shiny app helping new `ggplot` learners and motivate them.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of ggplotIntro from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("ggplotIntro") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can instal development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ycui0008/ggplotIntro")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggplotIntro)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(who_covid)
```
