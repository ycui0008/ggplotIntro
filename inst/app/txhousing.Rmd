For Q5, we will use `txhousing` data. For simplification, we only use top-3 sales cities in 2000.

The chunk below is data wrangling part.

```{r}
top3_cities <- txhousing %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>% # filter out year 2000
  group_by(city) %>% 
  summarise(tot_sales = sum(sales)) %>% # total sales in 2000
  top_n(3) %>% # filter out top 3 cities
  pull(city)

top3_txhousing <- txhousing %>% 
  filter(year == 2000, city %in% top3_cities) %>% # filter out top 3 cities in 2000
  group_by(city, month) %>% 
  summarise(tot_sales = sum(sales)) # cauculate monthly total sales 

head(top3_txhousing) # have a look at the data
```
