### Polygon(`geom_polygon()`) is a simple way to draw maps -- it draws boundaries for different regions.

#### Step 1: get map data

Use `ggplot2::map_data()` to get the wanted map data.

```{r}
# install.packages('map') # map package is required
world <- map_data('world')

head(world)
```

We can see what map data looks like. Different countries and regions have different `group` number. If you want to get map data other than **world**, try `?map_data`.

#### Step 2: draw the map

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = 'white', # This is the colour within countries' boundaries
               colour = 'grey' # This is background colour
               ) + 
  coord_quickmap() # This is map projections, there are many other types of map projections
```

##### What if we use `geom_point()`, instead?

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.25) + 
  coord_quickmap() 
```

Now, we can see each country's boundaries are plotted as points. 

### Let's see what we can do for `who_covid` data

`who_covid` records COVID-19 cases and deaths in the countries of the world. Try to use `?who_covid` to read more information about the data.

```{r}

url <- 'https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv'

who_covid <- read_csv(url) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    dplyr::select(
        name,
        who_region,
        cases_cumulative_total,
        cases_cumulative_total_per_100000_population,
        deaths_cumulative_total,
        deaths_cumulative_total_per_100000_population
    )
# all codes above will be replaced once the shiny is in the package


head(who_covid)
```

Before we using `geom_polygon()` to draw a map, we need to join `world` data to `who_covid` data, because originally `who_covid` data does not contain countries' map data. 

First, rename USA and UK, because in world data United States of America is called USA and United Kingdom is called UK.

```{r}
covid <-
  mutate(who_covid, name = case_when(name == "United States of America" ~ "USA", 
                          name == "United Kingdom" ~ "UK",
                          TRUE ~ name))
```

Second, merge two data set into one data set.

```{r}
covid_map <- left_join(covid[-1,], # -1 is to deselect Global data
          world,      
          by = c("name" = "region") # select name and region to join by
          )
```

Finally, draw the map.

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = cases_cumulative_total)) + 
  geom_polygon(colour = 'white') + 
  coord_quickmap()
```
